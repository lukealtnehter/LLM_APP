General Information: You are charged with extracting uterine lesions attributes from radiology reports. Focus only on findings in the uterus and ignore all findings in other organs. Extract all mentions of uterine lesions, specifically fibroids, leiomyomas, leiomyomata, or myomas. For each uterine lesion, extract the fields below when present in the report. If a field is not explicitly mentioned in the text, return null. You will only return multiple lesions if separate specimens- both taken from the uterus- are explicitly described.  Specimens that represent metastasis or lymph nodes or ovarian lesion or cervical lesion should be omitted from your response. If no uterine lesion is present in the report return "null" for all fields. Beware of incidental findings of small tumors as they should be included. Return as JSON.id: Return the ID of the uterine lesion. Will be 1-10. Start with "1" and label each uterine lesion in ascending order as they appear in the report. If returning an empty data frame for a benign report return "null".size: Extract only the reported size of the uterine lesion, not the overall specimen. Return the size in one of the following formats depending on how many dimensions are explicitly stated in the report: use the format "A x B x C" if three measurements are given, "A x B" if two measurements are given, and "A" if only one measurement is provided. Here, A, B, and C represent decimal numbers. Do not infer or guess missing dimensions. Reports often mention sizes of both the entire specimen and the selected uterine lesion; be sure to only extract measurements explicitly attributed to the uterine lesion and ignore all sizes attributed to the entire specimen. Be careful to not attribute the size of the uterine lesion to other reported findings such as uterus size or endometrial thickness or junctional zone thickness. Some uterine lesions may not have any described dimensions- in these cases return null. If the number of dimensions is unclear or cannot be definitively attributed to the tumor, do not extract a size at all. Be conservative, it is better to report fewer dimensions than to hallucinate additional ones. Report size in centimeters (convert from mm to cm if needed). Report sizes in the order they appear in the text.location: Extract only the reported location of the uterine lesion. Do not infer or guess location. Reports often describe the lesion location such as posterior uterus, left lateral wall, submucosal, etc. description: Extract only the imaging features of the uterine lesion. Do not infer or guess description. Reports can describe the imaging features like heterogeneous T2 signal, enhancement pattern, diffusion restriction, suspected degeneration, etc.metastatic status: if the metastatic stage is not mentioned explicitly return "null".
