Instruction:
Focus only on findings in the kidney. Extract all solid, non-cystic renal masses from the narrative that are concerning for kidney cancer. Ignore all benign cysts and findings in other organs. If there are no concerning kidney lesions, return an empty dataframe. Return as JSON.

For each lesion, extract the following fields when present in the report. If a field is not mentioned in the text, return null. Reports were made by humans so beware of obvious typos (mixing up the side of the lesion from the impression to the report).

lesion_id: A unique identifier that must be in the format "lesion #n". This may not always be explicitly stated for a lesion. Rerports with single lesions will always be "lesion #1". Identify the number of concerning non-cystic kidney lesions. If there are multiple lesions that are not explicitly labeled, you label them in the order they are mentioned in the report (lesion #1 is menitoned first followed by lesion #2). 

truesize: "A (ap) x B (ll) x C (cc)" format if all measurements and dimensions are given. Give all the dimenisions  and measurments provided, if there are missing dimensions leave them blank- do not put 0 as this implies the dimension was given as "0". This field will be  "0.5" for subcentimeter lesions. If a size is not given for the lesion, the field will be "null" This is the current reported size of the lesion.

size_unit: Unit of all measurments
- cm
- mm

ccLS: Clear cell Likelihood Score (1–5 explicitly mentioned for each lesion, if ccls is not reported for a lesions ie: in bosniak cystic lesions, put null. Note: Do not infer ccLS based on other classifications such as the Bosniak cyst classification—these are distinct systems.

side: which kidney is the lesion loacated in
- left
- right

location: described anatomical location of the individual lesion within the kidney. Location will be described in the report by  a combination of the following words: 

height one of: 
- mid (sometimes referred to as interpolar) 
- lower
- upper 
Laterality one of: 
- medial
- lateral  
AP one of: 
- midline
- anterior
- posterior

- null if not mentioned

Choose the list of descriptors that used for an individual lesion in the report. 

prior_size: This must be a prior size, not the current size. May or may not be referenced. "A (ap) x B (ll) x C (cc)" format should be used if all dimensions are given. Give as many dimensions as the report says,if there are missing dimensions leave them blank- do not put 0 as this implies the dimension was given as "0". For previously "subcentimeter" lesions, this field should be "0.5". For Lesions described as stable or unchanged you will put the copy prior_size from the truesize. For lesions that were explicitly not seen in the comparison, put "not seen". Put null if a prior size is not mentioned.

prior_date: This is the date of the "prior_size". Most commonly found in the "COMPARISON:" section. The comparison is a previous imaging study (mri or ct). If prior_size is not reported for a lesion, then prior_date must also be null. Some lesions may report a previous size and directly give a pervious date. Be carful to not put the date listed at the bottom of the report as this is the date the report was signed. Format is YYYY-MM-DD.

mri_staging: Tumor staging of the lesion given in the report: 
- T1a
- T1b 
- T2 
- T3
- T4
- null if not mentioned

percent_endophytic: Quanification of the degree the lesions is endophytic: 
- <25%
- 25-50%
- 50-75%
- 75-99%
- 100%
- null if not mentioned

depth_extension: how deep the lesion extends in the kidney
- Renal parenchyma
- Renal/hilar interface
- Hilar fat/collecting system
- null if not mentioned

t2_signal_relative_to_renal_cortex: T2 signal relative to the renal cortex and how homogenous is the signal:
one of:
- Hyperintense
- Isointense
- Hypointense
and one of:
- Slightly heterogeneous ("Slightly" and "mildly" are interchangeable.)
- Homogeneous
- Heterogeneous

- null if not mentioned  


t1_chemical_shift: does the t1 chemical shift artifact suggest a lesion with fat:
- Macroscopic fat
- Microscopic fat ("Intravoxel" may be used instead of "microscopic".)
- No fat
- null if not mentioned  

segmental_inversion_enhancement: is there segmental inversion enhacement in the lesion:
- Present
- Absent
- Not applicable
- null if not mentioned

corticomedullary_enhancement_relative_to_renal_cortex: how does the corticomedulary (delayed) phase enhance relative to the renal coretex and how homogenous is the signal:

Relative enhancement one of: 
- Intense = 100%
- Moderate = 50%
- Mild = 30%
- NA 

Homogenecity one of: 
- Homogeneous 
- Slightly heterogeneous
- Heterogeneous
- NA

- null if not mentioned

high_b_value_dwi: High b-value DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) + ADC (apparent diffusion coeffecient) of the lesion

DWI one of:
- Hyperintensity
- Isointense
- Hypointense
ADC one of: 
- Hyperintensity
- Isointense
- Hypointense


delayed_enhancement: does the lesion have delayed enhancement. One of:
- plateau (+/-10%)
- progressive (>10%)
- washout (<10%)
- NA 
- null if not mentioned


fat_poor_aml_suspected: Is the lesion suspected to be fat poor aml (angiomyolipoma)?:
- Yes
- No 
- null if not mentioned explicitly. 

tumor_margin: tumor margin description- one of: 
- frankly infiltrative
- ill-defined focal 
- well defined, complete
- null if not mentioned

tumor_invasion: Extrarenal invasion of the mass one of:
- Possible (lobulated margin)
- Not present (smooth margin)
- Clearly present (frank infiltration into perirenal fat)
or null if not mentioned

renal_vein_anatomy: three anatomic variants of the renal vein of interest:
- usual 
- circumaortic 
- retroaortic
- null if not mentioned. 

Must be the same for all lesions on a report.as the anatomy is shared.

renal_vein_thrombus: presence of renal vein thrombus one of:
- Absent
- intra-renal
- extra-renal renal vein = Level 0
- IVC no more than 2 cm above the renal vein = Level I
- IVC more than 2 cm above the renal vein but below hepatic vein = Level II
- IVC above hepatic vein but below diaphragm  = Level III
- Supra-diaphragmatic IVC or right atrium = Level IV
- null if not mentioned

Must be the same for all lesions on a report as the anatomy is shared.

renal_artery_anatomy: anatomical description of the anatomy of either 
renal artery. Only one side needs have an accessory to be included. One of:  
- Single artery
- Accessory artery for upper pole 
- Accessory artery for lower pole
- Accessory arteries for both upper and lower pole
- null if not mentioned. 

Must be the same for all lesions on a report as the anatomy is shared.

renal_artery_stenosis: Quantification of the degree of renal artery stenosis:
- absent
- 50%
- 50-75%
- 75-99% 
- null if not mentioned. 

Must be the same for all lesions on a report as the anatomy is shared.

Final Reminder:
The information in the reports may be from a structured template that radiologists fill out. Some templates may not have every field. Some reports will be unstructued.

**Do not guess, assume, or infer. Only include solid, non-cystic lesions of the kidney**
