General Information: You are charged with extracting primary renal tumor attributes from pathology reports. Focus only on findings in the kidney and ignore all findings in other organs.  For each kidney tumor, extract the fields below when present in the report. If a field is not explicitly mentioned in the text, return null. You will only return multiple tumors if separate specimens- both taken from the kidney- are explicitly described. If the a specimen is taken from a blood vessel (vena cava, renal artery, renal vein etc) or other tissue outside of the kidney, the specimen should be completely omitted from your answer.  Specimens that represent metastasis or lymph nodes should be omitted from your response. Specimens that are benign kidney parenchyma should be omitted from your answer. If no kidney tumors are present in the report (totally benign kidney parenchyma) return "null" for all fields. Beware of incidental findings of small tumors as they should be included. Return as JSON.

id: Return the ID of the kidney tumor. Will be 1-10. Start with "1" and label each kidney tumor in ascending order as they appear in the report. If returning an empty data frame for a benign report return "null".

side: which kidney is the tumor located in
- L (left)
- R (right)
- null if not mentioned

location: described anatomical location of the individual lesion within the kidney. Location will be described in the report by  a combination of the following words: 

height one of: 
- mid (sometimes referred to as interpolar) 
- lower
- upper 
Laterality one of: 
- medial
- lateral  
AP one of: 
- midline
- anterior
- posterior


size: Extract only the reported size of the kidney tumor, not the overall specimen. Return the size in one of the following formats depending on how many dimensions are explicitly stated in the report: use the format "A x B x C" if three measurements are given, "A x B" if two measurements are given, and "A" if only one measurement is provided. Here, A, B, and C represent decimal numbers. Do not infer or guess missing dimensions. Reports often mention sizes of both the entire specimen and the selected kidney tumor; be sure to only extract measurements explicitly attributed to the kidney tumor and ignore all sizes attributed to the entire specimen. Be careful to not attribute the size of the kidney tumor to other reported findings such as stones/calculi. Some kidney tumors may not have any described dimensions- in these cases return null. If the number of dimensions is unclear or cannot be definitively attributed to the tumor, do not extract a size at all. Be conservative, it is better to report fewer dimensions than to hallucinate additional ones. Report sizes in the order they appear in the text. When unit is mentioned, add cm or mm at the end.

hist: return the the subtype of tumor in abbreviated format. Abbreviations are as follows: ccRCC (Clear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as Clear cell RCC, Conventional RCC, Clear tumor cells with extensive hyalinized and fibrous stroma, or Cystic clear cell renal cell carcinoma), pRCC (Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as Papillary RCC, Type 1 and Type 2 papillary RCC, Papillary features with eosinophilic cytoplasm, or foamy macrophages), cdRCC (Collecting Duct Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as Bellini duct carcinoma), uRCC (Unclassified Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as Not otherwise specified RCC, Residual or poorly differentiated carcinoma, not further classifiable RCC, RCC unclassified, or Uncertain malignant potential), tRCC (Translocation-associated Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as Xp11 translocation RCC, TFE3-altered RCC, or TFEB-altered RCC), HLRCC (Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as FH-deficient RCC), non-RCC (Malignant non-Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as Non-RCC metastasis or secondary renal malignancy), chRCC (Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as Sarcomatoid or Dedifferentiated Chromophobe RCC), ACD-RCC (Acquired Cystic Disease-associated Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as RCC associated with end-stage renal disease), ELOC-RCC (ELOC-mutated Renal Cell Carcinoma: Formerly known as TCEB1-mutated RCC), ESC-RCC (Eosinophilic Solid and Cystic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as ESC RCC or Eosinophilic vacuolated tumor), Tc-RCC (Tubulocystic Renal Cell Carcinoma), MTSC-RCC (Mucinous Tubular and Spindle Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma), SDH-def RCC (Succinate Dehydrogenase-deficient Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as SDH-deficient RCC), Hybrid (Hybrid Tumor with Chromophobe and Oncocytic Features: Also known as Hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumor or HOCT), ONC (specifically oncocytoma), ONCNEO (any other unspecified oncocytic neoplasm), PA (Papillary Adenoma: Also known as Small papillary tumor <15 mm), RHB (Renal Hemangioblastoma), JGCT (Juxtaglomerular Cell Tumor: Also known as Reninoma), RMICT (Renomedullary Interstitial Cell Tumor: Also known as Medullary fibroma or Renal hamartoma), MA (Metanephric Adenoma: Also known as Metanephric adenofibroma or Metanephric stromal tumor), ccpRCT (Clear-cell Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma: Also known as Clear cell papillary RCC or Multifocal tumor with papillary features and clear cytoplasm), MCRNLMP (Multilocular Cystic Renal Neoplasm of Low Malignant Potential: Also known as Multilocular cystic RCC (obsolete) or Cystic RCC with indolent behavior), AML (Angiomyolipoma: Also known as Epithelioid angiomyolipoma, PEComa, or Fat-containing renal tumor), ADC (Adenocarcinoma: Also known as Non-RCC primary adenocarcinoma), GCT (Germ Cell Tumor: Also known as Extragonadal germ cell tumor), PDC (Poorly Differentiated Carcinoma: Also known as High-grade carcinoma, NOS), SAR (Sarcoma: Subtypes include Leiomyosarcoma, Liposarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma), WT (Wilms Tumor: Also known as Nephroblastoma), MEST (Mixed Epithelial and Stromal Tumor: Also known as Cystic nephroma or Biphasic renal tumor), UC (urothelial Carcinoma or papillary urothelial carcinoma), and BH (benign hemangioma).

grade: return the Nuclear Grade from 1-4. Return null if not mentioned. May be reported as "a/4" where a is the grade and 4 denotes the max grade for a tumor. May also be described as G1-4.

pT: return the pathologic tumor stage (pT): possible values are:
T1: tumor limited to kidney < 7cm
- T1a: < 4 cm
- T1b: > 4 cm and < 7 cm
T2: tumor limited to kidney > 7 cm
-T2a: > 7 cm and < 10 cm
-T2b: >10 cm
T3: tumor invades renal vein/IVC or surrounding tissues (not past Gerota's fascia or adrenal gland)
- T3a: tumor invades surrounding fat, pelvicalyceal system, or the renal vein 
- T3b: infra diaphragmatic IVC
- T3c: supra diaphragmatic IVC or IVC wall
T4: invades adrenal gland or beyond Gerota's fascia

return "null" is the T stage it not explicitly mentioned, for TX, or if tumor staging is not applicable.

pN: return the pathologic lymph node stage of the tumor(pN or N): possible values are:
N0: multiple lymph nodes were reviewed by the pathologist but none were positive for tumor. 
N1: involvement of regional lymph node(s)

if the lymph node stage is not mentioned explicitly return "null". If the lymph node stage is described as pNX/x or not applicable return "null". If the pathologist was not given any lymph nodes return "null". Often given in the format pT1b NxMx. Be careful, do not put "0" when lymph nodes were never evaluated - you should return "null" in these cases.



pM: return the metastatic stage of the tumor (pM or M): possible values are:
M0: distant metastases were evaluated and were negative
M1: distant metastases were evaluated and were positive

if the metastatic stage is not mentioned explicitly return "null". If the metastatic stage is not applicable, cannot be assessed, or pMX/x return "null". Often given in the format pT1b NxMx. Be careful, do not put "0" when metastatic sites were never evaluated - you should return "null" in these cases.
